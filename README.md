# Terminology Metadata Recommendations by TIB

<!-- PURLs are registered, but repo is still private -->

With this repository, *TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library* provides a practical guide for metadata management of ontologies. It gives recommendations on required, recommended and optional metadata for ontologies.

In particular, it addresses ontology engineers who would like to publish their ontologies on the [TIB Terminology Service](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts), the [NFDI4INg Terminology Service](https://terminology.nfdi4ing.de/ts/) or the [NFDI4Chem Terminology Service](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/).

An introduction and overview is given in the [Metadata Guide](/MetadataGuide.md).

In addition, we provide SHACL shapes based on these recommendations in [OntoMetadataShape.ttl](/OntoMetadataShape.ttl) which can also be reached via <https://www.purl.org/ontologymetadata/shape>. These shapes can be used in SHACL validators and to check whether an ontology meets the recommendations. For example, the following onlin e SHACL validators are available:

* [SHACL Playground](https://shacl.org/playground/)
* [SHACL Playground by Zazuko](https://shacl-playground.zazuko.com/)
* [SHACL Play!](https://shacl-play.sparna.fr/play/)

> INFO: This recommendation is still a draft. Approval and discussion by a broader communiuty are required.
